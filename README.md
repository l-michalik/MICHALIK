# Michalik

This repository documents my personal journey to becoming a **professional AI/ML Developer**.  
It's a growing collection of experiments, tools, and real-world projects focused on solving problems through machine learning and artificial intelligence.

> Built with purpose. Updated with progress.

## 🎯 Why This Repo

- 🧠 To explore and understand core concepts in AI/ML  
- 🛠️ To apply that knowledge in code that runs and scales  
- 📈 To track and showcase continuous improvement  
- 🚀 To build a launchpad for production-ready solutions  

Every addition here is something I've studied, implemented, or deployed — no fluff.

## 🧱 My AI/ML Tech Stack *(in progress)*

This section will evolve as I build and refine my toolkit:

### Languages & Libraries
- Python  
- LangChain, LlamaIndex, Haystack  
- Hugging Face Transformers, SentenceTransformers  
- Uvicorn, dotenv  

### Data & Visualization
- pandas, numpy, datasets  
- Matplotlib, seaborn (when needed)  

### Machine Learning
- Scikit-learn  
- Model training pipelines with custom preprocessing  
- Feature engineering (forward/backward time features, holidays, promotions, embeddings)  
- Statistical model evaluation (Jarque-Bera, t-test, Wald test, time series diagnostics)  

### Deep Learning
- Keras (Sequential API)  
- Entity Embeddings for categorical features  
- Mistral, LLaMA2, Gemini  
- OpenAI GPT APIs  

### Deployment
- Docker  
- FastAPI, Uvicorn  

### MLOps & Tooling
- Local and cloud vector databases: FAISS, Weaviate, Pinecone

## 🛤️ What's Next

I'm currently focusing on:
- Implementing ML algorithms from scratch  
- Experimenting with deep learning models (NLP & CV)  
- Building small end-to-end projects and APIs  
- Learning model deployment and tracking tools (FastAPI, MLflow, Docker)  
- Extending production-grade pipelines for tabular data and vector search
