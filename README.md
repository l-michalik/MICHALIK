# Michalik

This repository documents my personal journey to becoming a **professional AI/ML Developer**.  
It's a growing collection of experiments, tools, and real-world projects focused on solving problems through machine learning and artificial intelligence.

> Built with purpose. Updated with progress.

## 🎯 Why This Repo

- 🧠 To explore and understand core concepts in AI/ML  
- 🛠️ To apply that knowledge in code that runs and scales  
- 📈 To track and showcase continuous improvement  
- 🚀 To build a launchpad for production-ready solutions  

Every addition here is something I've studied, implemented, or deployed — no fluff.
