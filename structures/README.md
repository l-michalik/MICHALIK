# Project summary
I’ll give you a code file or text. Extract the key purpose, functionality, usage, then generate a clean, well-structured README.md 
based only on that input. Include title, description, usage. Do not invent details — use only what's in the input.
Everything should be in .md stucture, without requirements - ready to download

Goal, Key Learnings, Technologies, Takeaways, Shared Concepts, Features
Use only the given content. Keep it clear and structured and give only 
one and short mind for each of them
