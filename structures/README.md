# Summary structure

I will send you a Python code file for a project. Based only on the code, generate a README.md-style section. The output should include a project block with four labeled items: Goal (describing what the code does), Key Learnings (explaining what the implementation demonstrates), Technologies (listing the tools or libraries used explicitly in the code), and Takeaways (summarizing what can be applied or reused in other contexts). After that, include a section titled "Shared Concepts & Reusable Patterns" with a single entry labeled [00], and another section titled "Features" with one entry also labeled [00]. Everything must be strictly based on what’s present in the code — do not invent or assume anything beyond that. Format your output exactly like a markdown README.
