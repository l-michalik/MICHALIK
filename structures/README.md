# Project summary
Iâ€™ll give you a code file or text. Extract the key purpose, functionality, usage, then generate a clean, well-structured README.md 
based only on that input. Include title, description, usage. Do not invent details â€” use only what's in the input.
Everything should be in .md stucture, without requirements - ready to download

# Stack knowledge
From the README or documentation I provide, extract one project with:
Goal, Key Learnings, Technologies, Takeaways, Shared Concepts, Features
Use only the given content. Keep it clear and structured and give only 
one and short mind for each of them

# Summary structure

### Project 1 (LLM-Powered RAG with LlamaIndex)

- **Goal**: Build a lightweight, file-based RAG system using LlamaIndex and Hugging Face-hosted models for local document QA.
- **Key Learnings**: LlamaIndex abstracts complex retrieval and generation workflows, making it fast to prototype production-grade RAG systems.
- **Technologies**: Python, LlamaIndex, HuggingFace Hub, Mistral-7B-Instruct, SentenceTransformers
- **Takeaways**: Lightweight RAG pipelines can be quickly implemented without a full vector database by using local indexing tools like LlamaIndex.
