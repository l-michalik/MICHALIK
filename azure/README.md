### 01
Cloud computing is a service delivery model over the internet (the cloud), offering a range of services including compute power (such as Windows or Linux servers and hosting environments), storage (files and databases), networking (both within Azure and external connections to company networks), and analytics services for visualization and telemetry data. Key concepts in cloud computing include scalability, which refers to the ability to allocate and deallocate resources as needed; elasticity, which means dynamically scaling resources based on demand; and agility, the capacity to react and adapt quickly to changes. Fault tolerance ensures that the system remains operational even when some components fail, while disaster recovery involves designing systems that can recover from natural or human-induced disasters. Finally, high availability refers to the expected operational uptime of a system, typically calculated using the formula:
availability = uptime / (uptime + downtime).

### 02
Economies of scale refer to the principle that as companies grow, they become more efficient at managing shared operations such as HR, hiring, taxes, accounting, internal processes, marketing, and large contract-based purchases—often resulting in better discounts. These efficiencies allow companies to save or earn more, enabling them to reduce the cost of their services for customers, often referred to as lowering the price per unit. While the cost can never reach zero due to the need for underlying infrastructure, increasing scale allows more cost savings to be passed on. At current levels, companies like Microsoft can even offer some services for free, as their cost is negligible at such massive scale.

### 03
Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx) represent two different financial approaches to spending in a business. CapEx involves significant upfront investment, such as purchasing hardware or infrastructure, with lower ongoing costs. These costs are typically capitalized and deducted over time through depreciation. CapEx also comes with long-term commitments and limited flexibility, as early termination is usually not an option. It requires substantial maintenance and the value of the asset typically decreases over time. In contrast, OpEx is based on a pay-as-you-go model with no upfront costs. Expenses are directly tied to usage, making them easier to scale. They are fully tax-deductible in the same year and offer flexibility, including the ability to cancel services at any time. OpEx also involves minimal maintenance and does not impact long-term asset value.

### 04
The consumption-based model is a cloud pricing approach where customers are charged only for the resources they actually use. It eliminates upfront costs and avoids paying for unused resources—though "unused" depends on the service. For example, any blob storage holding data is considered "used" because it occupies space, while virtual machines incur charges as long as they are running, even without active traffic, due to ongoing CPU and memory consumption. This model emphasizes flexibility: pay only for what you need, and stop paying when you don’t. Azure tracks consumption using detailed, service-specific metrics, measured at a granular level, to ensure accurate billing and cost efficiency.

### 05
In cloud computing, the term "as a service" refers to which party—either the customer or the cloud provider—is responsible for managing a particular layer and all layers below it. These layers include: the software layer, which consists of the application and its data; the platform layer, which includes runtime, middleware, and the operating system; and the infrastructure layer, which covers virtualization, servers, networking, and storage. In an on-premises setup, the customer is responsible for managing all layers. In Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), the cloud provider manages the infrastructure layer, while the customer manages everything above it. With Platform as a Service (PaaS), the provider handles both the infrastructure and platform layers, leaving only the application and data to the customer. Finally, in Software as a Service (SaaS), the cloud provider manages all layers, delivering a fully managed solution where the customer simply uses the application.

### 06
A Cloud Deployment Model defines where a company's resources are hosted—either in a public cloud provider's infrastructure or within the company’s own datacenter. There are three main models: Public Cloud, Private Cloud, and Hybrid Cloud. In the Public Cloud, all services run on the provider’s hardware with no local infrastructure required. It offers benefits like no upfront investment (CapEx), high availability, scalability, and pay-as-you-go pricing, but comes with limitations in compliance, ownership, and flexibility for rare scenarios. The Private Cloud runs entirely on the company’s own datacenter, offering full control, the ability to meet strict compliance requirements, and support for any use case—but at the cost of significant investment, limited agility, and dependency on in-house IT expertise. Hybrid Cloud combines both, enabling businesses to keep sensitive workloads on-premises while using the public cloud for scalability and modern services. This model offers maximum flexibility and compatibility but is also the most complex and costly to manage due to the need for broad technical expertise across both environments.

### 07
A Data Center is a physical facility hosting a group of networked servers, complete with its own power, cooling, and networking infrastructure. A Region refers to a geographic area containing one or more interconnected data centers with low-latency links (typically under 2 milliseconds). Some Azure services are tied to specific regions, while others are global and not bound to a region. Within a region, an Availability Zone is a grouping of physically separate data centers designed for fault isolation—so if one zone fails, the others remain operational. Services can be zonal (e.g., VMs, disks) or zone-redundant (e.g., SQL databases, storage). Not all regions support Availability Zones, but where they do, there are at least three. Each region is also part of a Region Pair—a statically defined partner region located within the same geography (e.g., East US and West US), usually separated by at least 300 miles to ensure data resiliency and coordinated updates. At the highest level, Geographies are discrete markets (e.g., Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific) containing multiple regions. They ensure data residency, sovereignty, and compliance, while also providing protection against large-scale outages affecting entire regions.

### 08
An Azure Resource is an object used to manage and operate cloud services, representing the full lifecycle of that service. Each resource is defined in JSON and is always assigned to exactly one Resource Group, which serves as a logical container for grouping related resources. These groups are typically organized by factors such as type, application lifecycle (e.g. dev, test, prod), department, billing, location, or a combination thereof. Azure Resource Manager acts as the unified management layer for all resources and groups, providing consistent tooling, access control, and deployment management. While a resource group itself has a designated location, the resources it contains can be distributed across different regions. Resources can be moved between groups, but groups cannot be nested. Organizing resources effectively should take into account billing, security, and the application's lifecycle to ensure efficient and secure cloud management.

### 09
Virtualization refers to the emulation of physical machines, allowing different virtual hardware and operating systems to run independently on the same physical host. Each virtual environment is fully isolated in terms of file systems, services, ports, middleware, and configuration. In Azure, Virtual Machines (VMs) are an IaaS offering that provides full control over the OS and software, making them ideal for custom configurations and lift-and-shift scenarios. Virtual Machine Scale Sets extend this by allowing auto-scaled deployments of identical VMs, suitable for web services and batch processing. Containers, in contrast, use the host's OS and are more lightweight and responsive, with lower compute and maintenance overhead. Azure Container Instances offer a fast, serverless way to run simple containers (PaaS), while Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a powerful, open-source container orchestration platform designed for complex and scalable deployments. App Service is a PaaS solution for enterprise-grade web apps, supporting multiple languages and container options. Lastly, Azure Functions (also PaaS) provide serverless execution for microservices, offering both consumption-based and dedicated pricing plans, making them ideal for lightweight, event-driven workloads.

### 10
In Azure, networking services allow seamless connectivity between cloud and on-premises environments while offering scalability, security, and performance. An Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is a logically isolated environment for deploying and managing networked resources, segmented into subnets for better organization and control. VNets are scoped to a single region but can communicate across regions via VNet peering. Key functions include isolation, segmentation, routing, filtering, and communication. The Azure Load Balancer distributes traffic evenly across resources, supporting both TCP and UDP protocols for internal and external traffic, enabling high availability and scalability with millions of simultaneous flows. A VPN Gateway connects on-premises networks to Azure over the public internet securely. The Application Gateway acts as a web traffic load balancer and includes features like a Web Application Firewall (WAF), SSL termination, session affinity, URL-based routing, and redirection. The Content Delivery Network (CDN) is used to minimize latency by distributing content to users via a globally distributed network of Points of Presence (PoPs). Together, these services replicate on-premises networking functionality in the cloud while enabling performance, security, and flexibility at scale.

### 11
Azure supports three main data types: Structured data, which follows strict schemas and is typically used in relational databases; Semi-structured data, which is more flexible and lacks rigid schema rules but still includes identifiable keys (common in NoSQL); and Unstructured data, such as media files, documents, or binaries. Azure’s Storage Account is a scalable and durable service that includes Blob Storage, Queue Storage, Table Storage, and File Storage, enabling storage of files, messages, and semi-structured data at petabyte scale with up to 16 nines of durability. Blob Storage is used for storing binary large objects (BLOBs) like images or videos and supports three tiers: Hot (frequent access), Cool (infrequent), and Archive (rare). Queue Storage is designed for scalable messaging in asynchronous workflows. Table Storage is a NoSQL solution ideal for fast access to semi-structured data without the need for foreign keys or joins. File Storage provides SMB-compatible shared drives, useful for migrating or extending on-prem file shares. Disk Storage provides persistent cloud-based disks for virtual machines, available in different sizes, types (SSD/HDD), and performance levels, and can be either managed or unmanaged.

### 12
Data in Azure is typically categorized into structured, semi-structured, and unstructured types. Structured data is highly organized, stored in tables with strict schemas and defined relationships, commonly used in relational databases. Semi-structured data lacks a fixed schema but includes unique identifiers for each record, while unstructured data includes files of any format, such as images, videos, and binaries. For semi-structured data, Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, schema-less NoSQL database service with multiple API options (SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, Table) and sub-10ms latency, ideal for real-time and multi-regional applications. For structured data, Azure offers a full SQL product family, including Azure SQL Database (PaaS), Azure Database for MySQL and PostgreSQL, SQL Managed Instance (a fully managed SQL Server environment), SQL on VM (SQL Server hosted via IaaS), and Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly SQL DW) for massively parallel data processing. These services support complex queries, high performance, scalability, and full cloud management for modern application development.

### 13
The Azure Marketplace is essentially a digital storefront—an “Azure Shop”—where users can discover, purchase, and deploy a wide range of solutions and services tailored for the Azure platform. Each product in the marketplace is a pre-configured template that may include one or multiple Azure services. These offerings come from both first-party (Microsoft) and third-party vendors and can span across all service models, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). It enables quick deployment of complex solutions while reducing setup time and simplifying integration.

### 14
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of internet-connected devices embedded in everyday objects, allowing them to send and receive data such as telemetry and configuration settings. Azure offers several services to support IoT solutions. Azure IoT Hub is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that enables secure, scalable, and reliable bi-directional communication between IoT devices and the cloud. It supports various protocols (HTTPS, AMQP, MQTT), integrates with other Azure services, and offers SDKs for popular programming languages. Azure IoT Central is a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution that simplifies the development of industry-specific IoT applications with no deep technical expertise required. It provides a secure, scalable, and fully managed platform built on top of IoT Hub and over 30 additional Azure services. For end-to-end device security, Azure Sphere offers certified microcontroller chips, a Linux-based Azure Sphere OS, and integrated Azure security services to ensure trusted communication between devices and the cloud.

### 15
Big Data refers to technologies and methods for extracting, processing, and analyzing data sets that are too large, fast, or complex for traditional software to handle. It is typically defined by the three V’s: Velocity (how quickly data is generated and processed, from batch to real-time), Volume (the scale of data, ranging from megabytes to petabytes), and Variety (the diversity of data formats, from structured tables to unstructured media like images, audio, and social posts). Azure provides several services for working with big data. Azure Synapse Analytics is a unified analytics platform (PaaS) that combines Spark, Synapse SQL (dedicated and on-demand), data pipelines, and a centralized studio for managing and analyzing large-scale data. Azure HDInsight is a flexible big data platform supporting a wide range of open-source frameworks such as Hadoop, Spark, Hive, Kafka, and HBase. Azure Databricks offers a collaborative workspace based on Apache Spark, designed for big data analytics and machine learning, with strong integration across the Azure ecosystem.

### 16
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence and capabilities by computer systems, enabling them to perform tasks such as reasoning, learning, and decision-making. Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of AI focused on teaching software to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Azure Machine Learning is a cloud-based Platform as a Service (PaaS) that enables the creation, training, deployment, and management of machine learning models. At its core is the Machine Learning Workspace, with a web-based Studio for end-to-end development. Key features include Notebooks (Python and R support), Automated ML (which tests multiple algorithms to find the best model), a Designer for no-code model building, as well as tools for managing Data & Compute and orchestrating workflows through Pipelines.

### 17
Serverless computing is a cloud execution model where applications run in fully managed environments, allowing developers to focus on code without managing infrastructure. Azure provides several serverless services. Azure Functions is a Function as a Service (FaaS) platform ideal for event-driven, nano-service applications, offering rapid scaling and support for multiple programming languages like .NET, Java, Python, and Node.js. Azure Logic Apps is a no-code serverless integration platform (PaaS) designed for automating business processes and orchestrating workflows across applications and services using over 200 prebuilt connectors. Azure Event Grid is a fully managed serverless event routing service that follows the publish-subscribe model, enabling reliable and near-real-time event handling across Azure services and custom applications.

### 18
DevOps is a set of practices that integrates software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle while maintaining high software quality through continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD). Azure DevOps is a comprehensive suite of tools designed to support DevOps workflows. It includes Boards for work tracking, Pipelines for building and deploying CI/CD workflows, Repos for source control with Git, Test Plans for manual and exploratory testing, and Artifacts for managing project deliverables. It is highly extensible via the Azure Marketplace and has evolved from earlier platforms like TFS and VSTS. Additionally, Azure DevTest Labs is a PaaS offering that enables teams to quickly create and manage sandbox environments using preconfigured VM templates, custom images, and lab policies (quotas, auto-shutdowns, etc.), with built-in support for automation and integration into CI/CD pipelines.

### 19
Azure Portal is a public, web-based interface for managing Azure resources through a customizable and user-friendly GUI, ideal for performing simple tasks and enabling self-service operations. For automation and scripting, Azure PowerShell offers a module-based environment using PowerShell commands (e.g., Connect-AzAccount, New-AzVm), and supports cross-platform usage via PowerShell Core. Similarly, the Azure CLI is a command-line tool built in Python, offering a straightforward syntax (e.g., az login, az vm create) for automating tasks using native terminal scripts. Azure Cloud Shell is a cloud-hosted scripting environment that supports both PowerShell and CLI, includes dozens of pre-installed tools, and integrates seamlessly with the Azure Portal, Visual Studio Code, Windows Terminal, and mobile apps. It provides users with an always-available, free shell environment directly from their browser or preferred client.

### 20
Azure Advisor is a free, personalized consulting service that provides actionable recommendations to help optimize your Azure environment. It analyzes your deployed resources and usage patterns to suggest best practices across five key areas: Cost (e.g., resizing SKUs, removing idle services, using reserved instances), Security (e.g., enabling MFA, fixing vulnerabilities, installing agents), Reliability (e.g., enabling redundancy, configuring soft delete for storage), Performance (e.g., right-sizing SKUs, updating SDKs, addressing I/O bottlenecks), and Operational Excellence (e.g., monitoring service health and subscription limits). Azure Advisor helps you improve efficiency, enhance security, and reduce costs by turning insights into practical, guided actions.

### 21
Network Security Groups (NSGs) are used to control and filter inbound and outbound traffic to Azure resources within a Virtual Network. They operate using customizable rules that define the source and destination (by IP, service tags, or Application Security Groups), protocol (TCP, UDP, or any), port numbers or ranges (e.g., 22 for SSH, 3389 for RDP, 80/443 for HTTP/HTTPS), traffic direction, and priority (which determines rule evaluation order). NSGs support multiple rules and are essential for implementing network-level access controls. Application Security Groups (ASGs) enhance NSGs by allowing you to group virtual machines logically, enabling easier rule management by referencing group names instead of individual IP addresses—thus simplifying configuration and ongoing maintenance.

### 22
Routing in Azure is the process of determining the path that network traffic takes within or across networks. By default, Azure provides built-in system routing for Virtual Networks. However, User-Defined Routes (UDRs) allow you to override this default behavior or introduce custom static routes. These are managed through the Azure Route Table resource, which can be associated with one or more subnets within a Virtual Network. UDRs are commonly used to direct traffic through network virtual appliances (NVAs), implement custom routing logic, or enforce security and traffic inspection policies.
