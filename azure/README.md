### 01
Cloud computing is a service delivery model over the internet (the cloud), offering a range of services including compute power (such as Windows or Linux servers and hosting environments), storage (files and databases), networking (both within Azure and external connections to company networks), and analytics services for visualization and telemetry data. Key concepts in cloud computing include scalability, which refers to the ability to allocate and deallocate resources as needed; elasticity, which means dynamically scaling resources based on demand; and agility, the capacity to react and adapt quickly to changes. Fault tolerance ensures that the system remains operational even when some components fail, while disaster recovery involves designing systems that can recover from natural or human-induced disasters. Finally, high availability refers to the expected operational uptime of a system, typically calculated using the formula:
availability = uptime / (uptime + downtime).

### 02
Economies of scale refer to the principle that as companies grow, they become more efficient at managing shared operations such as HR, hiring, taxes, accounting, internal processes, marketing, and large contract-based purchases—often resulting in better discounts. These efficiencies allow companies to save or earn more, enabling them to reduce the cost of their services for customers, often referred to as lowering the price per unit. While the cost can never reach zero due to the need for underlying infrastructure, increasing scale allows more cost savings to be passed on. At current levels, companies like Microsoft can even offer some services for free, as their cost is negligible at such massive scale.

### 03
Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx) represent two different financial approaches to spending in a business. CapEx involves significant upfront investment, such as purchasing hardware or infrastructure, with lower ongoing costs. These costs are typically capitalized and deducted over time through depreciation. CapEx also comes with long-term commitments and limited flexibility, as early termination is usually not an option. It requires substantial maintenance and the value of the asset typically decreases over time. In contrast, OpEx is based on a pay-as-you-go model with no upfront costs. Expenses are directly tied to usage, making them easier to scale. They are fully tax-deductible in the same year and offer flexibility, including the ability to cancel services at any time. OpEx also involves minimal maintenance and does not impact long-term asset value.

### 04
The consumption-based model is a cloud pricing approach where customers are charged only for the resources they actually use. It eliminates upfront costs and avoids paying for unused resources—though "unused" depends on the service. For example, any blob storage holding data is considered "used" because it occupies space, while virtual machines incur charges as long as they are running, even without active traffic, due to ongoing CPU and memory consumption. This model emphasizes flexibility: pay only for what you need, and stop paying when you don’t. Azure tracks consumption using detailed, service-specific metrics, measured at a granular level, to ensure accurate billing and cost efficiency.

### 05
In cloud computing, the term "as a service" refers to which party—either the customer or the cloud provider—is responsible for managing a particular layer and all layers below it. These layers include: the software layer, which consists of the application and its data; the platform layer, which includes runtime, middleware, and the operating system; and the infrastructure layer, which covers virtualization, servers, networking, and storage. In an on-premises setup, the customer is responsible for managing all layers. In Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), the cloud provider manages the infrastructure layer, while the customer manages everything above it. With Platform as a Service (PaaS), the provider handles both the infrastructure and platform layers, leaving only the application and data to the customer. Finally, in Software as a Service (SaaS), the cloud provider manages all layers, delivering a fully managed solution where the customer simply uses the application.
