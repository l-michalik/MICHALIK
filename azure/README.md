### 01
Cloud computing is a service delivery model over the internet (the cloud), offering a range of services including compute power (such as Windows or Linux servers and hosting environments), storage (files and databases), networking (both within Azure and external connections to company networks), and analytics services for visualization and telemetry data. Key concepts in cloud computing include scalability, which refers to the ability to allocate and deallocate resources as needed; elasticity, which means dynamically scaling resources based on demand; and agility, the capacity to react and adapt quickly to changes. Fault tolerance ensures that the system remains operational even when some components fail, while disaster recovery involves designing systems that can recover from natural or human-induced disasters. Finally, high availability refers to the expected operational uptime of a system, typically calculated using the formula:
availability = uptime / (uptime + downtime).

### 02
Economies of scale refer to the principle that as companies grow, they become more efficient at managing shared operations such as HR, hiring, taxes, accounting, internal processes, marketing, and large contract-based purchases—often resulting in better discounts. These efficiencies allow companies to save or earn more, enabling them to reduce the cost of their services for customers, often referred to as lowering the price per unit. While the cost can never reach zero due to the need for underlying infrastructure, increasing scale allows more cost savings to be passed on. At current levels, companies like Microsoft can even offer some services for free, as their cost is negligible at such massive scale.

### 03
Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx) represent two different financial approaches to spending in a business. CapEx involves significant upfront investment, such as purchasing hardware or infrastructure, with lower ongoing costs. These costs are typically capitalized and deducted over time through depreciation. CapEx also comes with long-term commitments and limited flexibility, as early termination is usually not an option. It requires substantial maintenance and the value of the asset typically decreases over time. In contrast, OpEx is based on a pay-as-you-go model with no upfront costs. Expenses are directly tied to usage, making them easier to scale. They are fully tax-deductible in the same year and offer flexibility, including the ability to cancel services at any time. OpEx also involves minimal maintenance and does not impact long-term asset value.

### 04
The consumption-based model is a cloud pricing approach where customers are charged only for the resources they actually use. It eliminates upfront costs and avoids paying for unused resources—though "unused" depends on the service. For example, any blob storage holding data is considered "used" because it occupies space, while virtual machines incur charges as long as they are running, even without active traffic, due to ongoing CPU and memory consumption. This model emphasizes flexibility: pay only for what you need, and stop paying when you don’t. Azure tracks consumption using detailed, service-specific metrics, measured at a granular level, to ensure accurate billing and cost efficiency.

### 05
In cloud computing, the term "as a service" refers to which party—either the customer or the cloud provider—is responsible for managing a particular layer and all layers below it. These layers include: the software layer, which consists of the application and its data; the platform layer, which includes runtime, middleware, and the operating system; and the infrastructure layer, which covers virtualization, servers, networking, and storage. In an on-premises setup, the customer is responsible for managing all layers. In Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), the cloud provider manages the infrastructure layer, while the customer manages everything above it. With Platform as a Service (PaaS), the provider handles both the infrastructure and platform layers, leaving only the application and data to the customer. Finally, in Software as a Service (SaaS), the cloud provider manages all layers, delivering a fully managed solution where the customer simply uses the application.

### 06
A Cloud Deployment Model defines where a company's resources are hosted—either in a public cloud provider's infrastructure or within the company’s own datacenter. There are three main models: Public Cloud, Private Cloud, and Hybrid Cloud. In the Public Cloud, all services run on the provider’s hardware with no local infrastructure required. It offers benefits like no upfront investment (CapEx), high availability, scalability, and pay-as-you-go pricing, but comes with limitations in compliance, ownership, and flexibility for rare scenarios. The Private Cloud runs entirely on the company’s own datacenter, offering full control, the ability to meet strict compliance requirements, and support for any use case—but at the cost of significant investment, limited agility, and dependency on in-house IT expertise. Hybrid Cloud combines both, enabling businesses to keep sensitive workloads on-premises while using the public cloud for scalability and modern services. This model offers maximum flexibility and compatibility but is also the most complex and costly to manage due to the need for broad technical expertise across both environments.

### 07
A Data Center is a physical facility hosting a group of networked servers, complete with its own power, cooling, and networking infrastructure. A Region refers to a geographic area containing one or more interconnected data centers with low-latency links (typically under 2 milliseconds). Some Azure services are tied to specific regions, while others are global and not bound to a region. Within a region, an Availability Zone is a grouping of physically separate data centers designed for fault isolation—so if one zone fails, the others remain operational. Services can be zonal (e.g., VMs, disks) or zone-redundant (e.g., SQL databases, storage). Not all regions support Availability Zones, but where they do, there are at least three. Each region is also part of a Region Pair—a statically defined partner region located within the same geography (e.g., East US and West US), usually separated by at least 300 miles to ensure data resiliency and coordinated updates. At the highest level, Geographies are discrete markets (e.g., Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific) containing multiple regions. They ensure data residency, sovereignty, and compliance, while also providing protection against large-scale outages affecting entire regions.

### 08
An Azure Resource is an object used to manage and operate cloud services, representing the full lifecycle of that service. Each resource is defined in JSON and is always assigned to exactly one Resource Group, which serves as a logical container for grouping related resources. These groups are typically organized by factors such as type, application lifecycle (e.g. dev, test, prod), department, billing, location, or a combination thereof. Azure Resource Manager acts as the unified management layer for all resources and groups, providing consistent tooling, access control, and deployment management. While a resource group itself has a designated location, the resources it contains can be distributed across different regions. Resources can be moved between groups, but groups cannot be nested. Organizing resources effectively should take into account billing, security, and the application's lifecycle to ensure efficient and secure cloud management.

### 09
Virtualization refers to the emulation of physical machines, allowing different virtual hardware and operating systems to run independently on the same physical host. Each virtual environment is fully isolated in terms of file systems, services, ports, middleware, and configuration. In Azure, Virtual Machines (VMs) are an IaaS offering that provides full control over the OS and software, making them ideal for custom configurations and lift-and-shift scenarios. Virtual Machine Scale Sets extend this by allowing auto-scaled deployments of identical VMs, suitable for web services and batch processing. Containers, in contrast, use the host's OS and are more lightweight and responsive, with lower compute and maintenance overhead. Azure Container Instances offer a fast, serverless way to run simple containers (PaaS), while Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a powerful, open-source container orchestration platform designed for complex and scalable deployments. App Service is a PaaS solution for enterprise-grade web apps, supporting multiple languages and container options. Lastly, Azure Functions (also PaaS) provide serverless execution for microservices, offering both consumption-based and dedicated pricing plans, making them ideal for lightweight, event-driven workloads.
