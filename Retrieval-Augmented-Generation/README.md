## 📦 Project-by-Project Breakdown

### Project 1 (End to End RAG Pipeline): 
- **Goal**: Enable LLMs to generate responses based on external data sources.
- **Key Learnings**: RAG integrates retrieval with generation using vector similarity.
- **Technologies**: Embedding models and vector databases must be dimensionally aligned.
- **Takeaways**: Retrieval quality directly impacts the accuracy of generated responses.

### Project 2 (RAG Architecture in Depth)
- **Goal**: Explore the components and techniques behind modern RAG systems.
- **Key Learnings**: Understanding various retrieval strategies enhances response quality and domain adaptability.
- **Technologies**: Sparse (TF-IDF, BM25), Dense (DPR, SBERT), Hybrid, Ensemble, Re-ranking (MonoT5, BGE-Reranker)
- **Takeaways**: The right combination of retrieval techniques improves relevance and factual grounding.
