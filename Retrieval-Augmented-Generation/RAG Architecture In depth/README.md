# RAG Architecture in Depth

This document explores the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture in depth. RAG enhances language model outputs by combining them with external knowledge sources. This hybrid approach improves factual accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and enables domain-specific reasoning in NLP applications.

## üîç Retrieval Techniques

Retrieval is the first step in any RAG system. Below are the main types of retrieval techniques used:

### Sparse Retrieval

Sparse retrieval methods such as **TF-IDF** and **BM25** rely on lexical overlap between the query and documents. Both the query and documents are represented as high-dimensional, sparse vectors that count word occurrences. The retrieval process focuses on exact word matching.

### Dense Retrieval

Dense retrieval uses neural network models like **DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval)** or **Sentence-BERT** to convert queries and documents into low-dimensional dense vectors. Retrieval is performed via vector similarity (e.g., dot product or cosine similarity), capturing semantic relationships beyond exact terms.

### Hybrid Retrieval

Hybrid retrieval combines sparse and dense methods to leverage the advantages of both. It can use weighted fusion of scores, or merge result sets to improve both recall and relevance. This approach increases robustness and performs well across diverse query types.

### Multi-hop Retrieval

Multi-hop retrieval performs retrieval in multiple stages. Each stage refines the query based on previous retrieved results. This is especially useful for complex queries requiring information scattered across multiple documents or reasoning chains.

### Memory-Augmented Retrieval

This technique uses short-term or long-term memory of past interactions to fetch relevant historical context. It's useful in conversational settings where maintaining coherence and context continuity is essential.

### Structured Retrieval

Structured retrieval queries structured data sources like SQL databases or knowledge graphs. Instead of full-text retrieval, the system executes queries against predefined schema or graph relationships, often translating natural language into structured query formats.

## ü§ñ Ensemble Retrieval & Re-ranking

In RAG, it's common to use multiple retrieval strategies together to improve quality. This is called ensemble retrieval. The outputs of various retrievers are combined and then passed through a **re-ranking** step, where a cross-encoder model (like MonoT5 or BGE-Reranker) evaluates and scores each candidate more accurately.

Ensemble and re-ranking methods increase precision and provide more semantically aligned inputs to the generator.

## üß± Creating a RAG System

A typical RAG pipeline includes the following components:

1. **Document Store** ‚Äì Stores preprocessed documents and their vector representations using tools like FAISS, Weaviate, or Elasticsearch.
2. **Retriever** ‚Äì Accepts a user query and returns relevant documents from the document store using sparse, dense, or hybrid techniques.
3. **Generator** ‚Äì A large language model (e.g., T5, GPT, Mixtral) that produces answers based on the retrieved documents.
4. **Pipeline Orchestration** ‚Äì Tools like LangChain or LlamaIndex manage the flow of data between components, including memory and context windows.

Key steps in building the system:
- Preprocess raw documents into manageable chunks.
- Embed documents using an encoder model.
- Store embeddings in a vector database.
- At runtime, encode the query, retrieve top-k documents, and generate a response.

## üß† Key Concepts in RAG

- **Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD):** A decoding approach where each document is encoded independently, and fusion happens only during generation.
- **Knowledge Grounding:** Retrieved documents are used as evidence, grounding the generated outputs in factual data.
- **End-to-End vs Modular:** RAG can be implemented as an end-to-end model or as separate retriever and generator modules.
- **Context Management:** The number, length, and quality of retrieved documents directly impact the generation performance.
