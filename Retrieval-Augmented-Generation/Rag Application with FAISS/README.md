# Retrieval-Augmented Generation with FAISS and LangChain

This project showcases the integration of document retrieval with language model generation using LangChain and FAISS.

## Overview

The approach combines traditional document processing with neural embeddings and vector similarity search to support grounded natural language responses. The core idea is to enhance the output of a language model by first retrieving relevant pieces of text from a knowledge base and then using them as part of the prompt for response generation.

## Key Concepts

- **Document Loading**: Text data is acquired and loaded into memory as a single document or set of documents.
- **Text Splitting**: Documents are split into smaller, overlapping chunks to preserve context and improve retrieval precision.
- **Embeddings**: Each chunk is converted into a dense vector representation using OpenAI’s embedding model.
- **Vector Store**: FAISS is used to store and index embeddings for fast similarity search.
- **Retrieval Pipeline**: Given a user query, the system finds the most similar text chunks using vector similarity.
- **Contextual Generation**: Retrieved text is included in a prompt to an LLM, enabling informed, context-aware answers.

## Technologies Used

- **LangChain** – for chaining the document and LLM operations
- **FAISS** – for efficient similarity search over vectorized content
- **OpenAI Embeddings** – for semantic representation of text
- **Recursive Character Text Splitter** – for smart chunking with context overlap

## Application Pattern

1. Load or fetch documents.
2. Split text into overlapping chunks.
3. Embed the chunks and store them in FAISS.
4. On user query:  
   a. Embed the query.  
   b. Retrieve relevant chunks.  
   c. Generate a response using both the query and the retrieved context.

This pattern is reusable across use cases such as document Q&A, knowledge assistants, internal search, and more.
