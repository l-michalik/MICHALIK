# Machine Learning

## Technologies & Methods Used

- **Feature Correlation Analysis**  
  Identifying relationships between input variables to reduce multicollinearity and improve model interpretability.

- **Feature Importance Evaluation**  
  Using tree-based models to assess which features contribute most to prediction performance.

- **Outlier Removal**  
  Filtering extreme values to reduce noise and improve generalization.

- **Dummy Variable Creation**  
  Transforming categorical variables into numerical format using one-hot encoding.

- **Random Forest Models**  
  - `RandomForestClassifier` for classification tasks  
  - `RandomForestRegressor` for regression tasks

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
  Leveraging `GridSearchCV` to find the best parameters for each model.

- **Model Comparison**  
  Evaluating various `scikit-learn` classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors) to select the most effective approach.

- **Business-Oriented Metrics**  
  Prioritizing recall and other business-aligned metrics, especially in scenarios where false negatives carry a high cost (e.g., fraud detection, customer churn).
