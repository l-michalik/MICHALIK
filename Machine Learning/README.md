- Check feature correlation
- Find important features
- Remove outliers
- Use one-hot encoding for categories
- Try Random Forest (Classifier & Regressor)
- Tune with GridSearchCV
- Compare models (LogReg, SVM, KNN)
- Focus on recall if false negatives are bad
- Export final model
- Compare different regressors
